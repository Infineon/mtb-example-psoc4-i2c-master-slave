# PSoC&trade; 4: I2C master EzI2C slave

This example demonstrates the operation of an I2C resource for PSoC&trade; 4 in master mode with an EzI2C slave. The I2C master is configured to send command packets to control a user LED on the slave. Both the slave and master are on the same device.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration for all the kits listed above, except for the CY8CPROTO-040T. For I2C functionality, change the SW2 switch towards I2C and populate R20 and R21 with 0-Ohm resistors to use the P2[2] and P2[3] pins (on the J11 header) on the CY8CPROTO-040T. See the kit guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

> **Note:** Some of the PSoC&trade; 4 kits ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox&trade; requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

Use jumper wires to establish a connection between the master and slave on the kit. For the default kit, do the following on the board (verify with **Device configurator** to find respective pins for other kits. You can access Device Configurator from the **Quick Panel**):

1. Connect P1[0] to P2[0].

2. Connect P1[1] to P2[1].

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-psoc4-i2c-master-slave](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-i2c-master-slave)" application with the desired name "Psoc4I2cMasterSlave" configured for the *CY8CKIT-041S-MAX* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-041S-MAX --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-i2c-master-slave --user-app-name Psoc4I2cMasterSlave --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```


The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).


</details>

### Open the project

After the project has been created, you can open it in your preferred development environment.

<details><summary><b>Eclipse IDE</b></summary>


If you opened the Project Creator tool from the included Eclipse IDE, the project will open in Eclipse automatically.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>Visual Studio (VS) Code</b></summary>

## Operation

1. Connect the master and slave I2C lines using jumper wires.

   Note that this connection needs to be made externally for this example to work.

2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM

## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings

PSoC&trade; 4 controls both the master and slave I2C resources. Both these resources are used from the same chip, so that you can test the functionality on a single kit.

The master sends packets to the slave with the command to turn ON or turn OFF the user LED. The packets are sent at an interval of 1 second. The EZI2C slave receives the packet and controls the LED according to the command.

**Table 1. Application resources**

Resource  |  Alias/object  |    Purpose
:-------- | :------------- | :------------
I2C       | CYBSP_I2C         | I2C master
EZI2C     | CYBSP_EZI2C       | EZI2C slave
GPIO      | CYBSP_USER_LED1   | LED indication
